# /spec-kitty.tasks-packages - Generate Work Package Files

**Version**: 3.2.0

## Purpose

Generate individual `tasks/WP*.md` prompt files from the manifest in `wps.yaml`.
This step reads `wps.yaml` (written in tasks-outline), updates it with per-WP
details, then generates the WP prompt files.

This step assumes `wps.yaml` already exists with complete WP definitions.

---

## 📍 WORKING DIRECTORY: Stay in the project root checkout

**IMPORTANT**: This step works in the project root checkout. NO worktrees created.

**In repos with multiple missions, always pass `--mission <handle>` to every spec-kitty command.** The `<handle>` can be the mission's `mission_id` (ULID), `mid8` (first 8 chars of the ULID), or `mission_slug`. The resolver disambiguates by `mission_id` and returns a structured `MISSION_AMBIGUOUS_SELECTOR` error on ambiguity — there is no silent fallback.

## User Input

The content of the user's message that invoked this skill (everything after the skill invocation token, e.g. after `/spec-kitty.<command>` or `$spec-kitty.<command>`) is the User Input referenced elsewhere in these instructions.

You **MUST** consider this user input before proceeding (if not empty).
## Steps

### 1. Setup

Run:

```bash
spec-kitty agent context resolve --action tasks_packages --mission <mission-slug> --json
```

Then execute the returned `check_prerequisites` command and capture
`feature_dir`. All paths must be absolute.

### 2. Load `wps.yaml`

Read `feature_dir/wps.yaml`. This is the manifest written in the previous step.
Each entry defines a WP with its `id`, `title`, `dependencies`, and partial metadata.

Parse all work package entries. The YAML structure is:

```yaml
work_packages:
  - id: WP01
    title: "..."
    dependencies: [...]   # may be present (authoritative) or absent
    owned_files: [...]    # may be absent — fill in this step
    requirement_refs: [...] # may be absent — fill in this step
    subtasks: [...]
    prompt_file: null     # fill in this step
```

### 3. Generate Prompt Files

For each work package defined in `wps.yaml`:

**CRITICAL PATH RULE**: All WP files MUST be created in a FLAT `feature_dir/tasks/` directory, NOT in subdirectories!

- Correct: `feature_dir/tasks/WPxx-slug.md` (flat, no subdirectories)
- WRONG: `feature_dir/tasks/planned/`, `feature_dir/tasks/doing/`, or ANY status subdirectories

**For each WP**:
1. Derive a kebab-case slug from the title
2. Filename: `WPxx-slug.md` (e.g., `WP01-create-html-page.md`)
3. Full path: `feature_dir/tasks/WP01-create-html-page.md`
4. Follow the WP prompt template structure below (**do NOT write instructions to read a template file from `.kittify/`**)
5. Include frontmatter with:
   - `work_package_id`, `subtasks` array, `dependencies`, history entry
   - `requirement_refs` array from the WP's `requirement_refs` in `wps.yaml`
   - `owned_files`, `authoritative_surface`, `execution_mode` (required ownership fields)
6. Include in body:
   - Objective, context, detailed guidance per subtask
   - Test strategy (only if requested)
   - Definition of Done, risks, reviewer guidance

**TARGET PROMPT SIZE**: 200-500 lines per WP (3-7 subtasks)
**MAXIMUM PROMPT SIZE**: 700 lines per WP (10 subtasks max)
**If prompts are >700 lines**: Split the WP — it's too large

**IMPORTANT**: All WP files live in flat `tasks/` directory. Status is managed via `status.events.jsonl`, not by directory location or frontmatter fields.

### 4. Update `wps.yaml` With Per-WP Details

After generating each WP prompt file, update the corresponding entry in `wps.yaml`
to fill in `owned_files`, `requirement_refs`, `subtasks`, and `prompt_file`.
Write the updated `wps.yaml` back to disk after each WP is generated (or
accumulate changes and write once at the end).

**Critical rule**: Do NOT modify a `dependencies` field that is already present in
`wps.yaml` — even if it is empty (`[]`). It is authoritative. Only populate
`dependencies` for entries where the key is **absent** from `wps.yaml`.

Example of a fully-populated entry after this step:

```yaml
- id: WP02
  title: "Build API"
  dependencies:
    - WP01
  owned_files:
    - "src/api/**"
  requirement_refs:
    - FR-001
    - NFR-001
  subtasks:
    - T001
    - T002
  prompt_file: "tasks/WP02-build-api.md"
```

The frontmatter in each WP prompt file MUST include a `dependencies` field:

```yaml
---
work_package_id: "WP02"
title: "Build API"
dependencies: ["WP01"]  # From wps.yaml
requirement_refs: ["FR-001", "NFR-001"]  # From wps.yaml requirement_refs
subtasks: ["T001", "T002"]
owned_files: ["src/api/**"]
authoritative_surface: "src/api/"
execution_mode: "code_change"
---
```

Include the correct implementation command:
- `spec-kitty agent action implement WP01 --agent <name>`
- `spec-kitty agent action implement WP02 --agent <name>`

`finalize_tasks` computes execution lanes from dependencies and write ownership. Agents never choose a base branch manually.

**Ownership rules**:
- `owned_files`: List of glob patterns for files this WP touches — no two WPs may overlap.
- `authoritative_surface`: Path prefix that must be a prefix of at least one `owned_files` entry.
- `execution_mode`: `"code_change"` for source code changes, `"planning_artifact"` for kitty-specs docs.
- Agents working on a WP must not modify files outside their `owned_files` list.

### 5. Self-Check

After generating each prompt:
- Subtask count: 3-7? ✓ | 8-10? ⚠️ | 11+? ❌ SPLIT
- Estimated lines: 200-500? ✓ | 500-700? ⚠️ | 700+? ❌ SPLIT
- Can implement in one session? ✓ | Multiple sessions needed? ❌ SPLIT

## Output

After completing this step:
- `feature_dir/tasks/WP*.md` prompt files exist for all work packages
- Each has proper frontmatter with `work_package_id`, `dependencies`, `owned_files`, `authoritative_surface`, `execution_mode`
- `feature_dir/wps.yaml` is fully populated: all `owned_files`, `requirement_refs`, `subtasks`, and `prompt_file` fields are set

**Next step**: `spec-kitty next --agent <name>` will advance to finalization.

## Prompt Quality Guidelines

**Good prompt** (~60 lines per subtask):
```markdown
### Subtask T001: Implement User Login Endpoint

**Purpose**: Create POST /api/auth/login endpoint that validates credentials and returns JWT token.

**Steps**:
1. Create endpoint handler in `src/api/auth.py`:
   - Route: POST /api/auth/login
   - Request body: `{email: string, password: string}`
   - Response: `{token: string, user: UserProfile}` on success
   - Error codes: 400, 401, 429

2. Implement credential validation:
   - Hash password with bcrypt
   - Use constant-time comparison

**Files**: `src/api/auth.py` (new, ~80 lines)
**Validation**: Valid credentials return 200 with token
```

**Bad prompt** (~20 lines per subtask):
```markdown
### T001: Add auth
Steps: Create endpoint. Add validation. Test it.
```
